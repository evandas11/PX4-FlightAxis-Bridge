# FlightAxis → PX4 Integration Specification

**RealFlight (FlightAxis Link) as a PX4 SITL simulator, integrated the way PX4's in-tree simulator bridges are: files live in the PX4 tree, get compiled by the PX4 make system, and launch with one `make` command.**

Version: 3.2 — July 2026
- v3.2: reconciled with the shipped implementation a second time. The helicopter moved to `CA_AIRFRAME 11` (tail servo) with a bipolar tail, real rate gains, a collective curve and yaw compensation (§5, §9, §12); the `HeliDemix` over-gain is now corrected in the bridge and is no longer a defect (§5, §12); `fields_updated` is sub-rated rather than `0x1FFF` on every message (§8.2); a realtime-factor monitor was added (§7); a dead PX4 link is terminal (§8.2); the quadplane's `FD_ACT_*` overrides were removed because the detector cannot fire in v1.16 SITL at all (§12); HITL support and ROS 2 verification landed (§8.2, §11); rotor-geometry magnitudes are normalised away by the allocator and only the symmetry matters (§9); airframe parameter forcing extended beyond `EKF2_GPS_DELAY` (§9); per-file line-number citations replaced with function and file names, which do not rot.
- v3.1: reconciled with the shipped implementation. Registration moved to the **PX4 v1.16 pattern** (`src/modules/simulation/simulator_mavlink/sitl_targets_flightaxis.cmake`, §3); baro/pitot units and the baro datum corrected (§6); DISTANCE_SENSOR and RAW_RPM documented, RC passthrough marked not implemented (§8.2); model-JSON example replaced with the real shipped channel maps and the rule that generates them (§5); airframe example marked abridged (§9); pitfalls ledger pruned of stale rows and extended with the fixes actually made (§12); validation status stated explicitly (§11).
- v3.0: restructured around PX4's **standalone-bridge pattern** (`Tools/simulation/` standalone bridge + build-system registration + `sitl_run.sh` + per-model JSON) — build it with the PX4 you already have, no PX4 stack modification.
- v2.0: all frame conversions & timing verified against the upstream FlightAxis implementation (§6–§7 — unchanged, still the ground truth).
- v1.0: external-bridge protocol groundwork.

## 1. The Pattern

PX4 already has a slot for an out-of-tree simulator that speaks Simulator-MAVLink, and
FlightAxis fills it exactly. The pieces:

| Piece | FlightAxis (this spec) |
|---|---|
| Bridge app | `Tools/simulation/flightaxis/flightaxis_bridge/` (standalone C++, own CMake) |
| Sim link | SOAP/HTTP TCP **18083** (RealFlight) |
| PX4 link | MAVLink HIL over **TCP 4560** (`px4_communicator.cpp`) |
| Sim launcher | `FA_check.py` (RealFlight runs on Windows — bridge just connects; script only pings 18083) |
| Model config | `models/<name>.json` (channel map, scale, options) |
| Runner | `Tools/simulation/flightaxis/sitl_run.sh` |
| Make registration | `simulator_mavlink/sitl_targets_flightaxis.cmake` (§3) |
| Build target | `make px4_sitl_nolockstep flightaxis_plane` |
| Airframe script | `ROMFS/.../init.d-posix/airframes/*_flightaxis_plane` etc. |

Key consequences:

- **No PX4 source modification.** PX4 sees a standard Simulator-MAVLink simulator on TCP 4560. The bridge is just compiled *alongside* PX4 by its make system (ExternalProject).
- **`nolockstep` board already exists** — it is the board for simulators whose clock cannot be stepped by PX4, which is exactly RealFlight's case. Nothing new to add in `boards/`.
- Integration is visible on the console from the runner + bridge. The block below is an
  **illustrative sketch of the expected shape of that output, not a captured transcript** —
  for what has actually been observed and what has not, see the validation status at the end of §11.
  ```
  $ make px4_sitl_nolockstep flightaxis_plane
  ...
  FlightAxis setup
  [flightaxis_bridge] connecting to RealFlight at 192.168.10.1:18083
  [flightaxis_bridge] controller injected, aircraft reset
  [flightaxis_bridge] waiting for PX4 on TCP 4560 ... connected
  [flightaxis_bridge] exchanges=247.3/s loop=612.7/s avg=248.1 FPS rtf=1.00 glitches=0
  INFO  [simulator_mavlink] Simulator connected on TCP port 4560
  ```

> **PX4 version note:** this pattern requires only the Simulator-MAVLink SITL path (TCP 4560)
> and a place to hang an `ExternalProject` plus the `make` targets. **v1.16 is what this repo
> is developed and tested against**, and there each simulator owns a
> `src/modules/simulation/simulator_mavlink/sitl_targets_<sim>.cmake` — so FlightAxis ships
> one too (§3). **v1.13–v1.15** instead centralised the same hooks in
> `platforms/posix/cmake/sitl_target.cmake`; that file no longer exists in v1.16, and the
> equivalent splice for those older trees is kept in §3.1. Either way no PX4 stack code is
> modified — only two `CMakeLists.txt` registration lines (§3.2).

```

Two registrations live in files PX4 owns, and both are mandatory — see §3.2. In particular the
four airframe scripts must **also** be listed in the airframes `CMakeLists.txt`; dropping the
files in without that entry configures and builds cleanly and they simply never reach the ROMFS.

Copied verbatim from upstream (byte-identical; provenance in `COPYRIGHT.md`):
`geo_mag_declination.{cpp,h}` and `cmake/FindMAVLink.cmake`. The latter is not optional — the bridge's `CMakeLists.txt` puts
`./cmake` on `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` and `find_package(MAVLink)` is what supplies the MAVLink
headers out of the PX4 build, so MAVLink is never a separate dependency to install.
`px4_communicator.{cpp,h}` is **adapted**, not copied: the original emits every
message on every frame, which at RealFlight's ~250 Hz would swamp PX4, so it gained per-message
decimation state and intervals, the `fields_updated` sub-rating, the DISTANCE_SENSOR path
(§8.2), the serial and UDP transports used for HITL, and the dead-link policy.

---

## 3. Build-System Registration — `sitl_targets_flightaxis.cmake` (PX4 v1.16)

In v1.16 each simulator owns one self-contained file under
`src/modules/simulation/simulator_mavlink/`, included from that directory's `CMakeLists.txt`.
FlightAxis follows that established file shape exactly. The whole file guards on
`ENABLE_LOCKSTEP_SCHEDULER STREQUAL "no"`, so the targets only exist on the `nolockstep` board —
which is correct, RealFlight free-runs and cannot be stepped.

`src/modules/simulation/simulator_mavlink/sitl_targets_flightaxis.cmake`:

```cmake
if(ENABLE_LOCKSTEP_SCHEDULER STREQUAL "no")

	# RealFlight runs on a remote Windows machine, so there is no local
	# simulator binary to find_program() for.

	include(ExternalProject)
	ExternalProject_Add(flightaxis_bridge
		SOURCE_DIR ${PX4_SOURCE_DIR}/Tools/simulation/flightaxis/flightaxis_bridge
		CMAKE_ARGS -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
		BINARY_DIR ${PX4_BINARY_DIR}/build_flightaxis_bridge
		INSTALL_COMMAND ""
		USES_TERMINAL_CONFIGURE true
		USES_TERMINAL_BUILD true
		EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL true
		BUILD_ALWAYS 1
	)

	# model list -> make px4_sitl_nolockstep flightaxis_<model>
	set(models plane quad quadplane heli)

	foreach(model ${models})
		add_custom_target(flightaxis_${model}
			COMMAND ${PX4_SOURCE_DIR}/Tools/simulation/flightaxis/sitl_run.sh
				$<TARGET_FILE:px4> ${model} ${PX4_SOURCE_DIR} ${PX4_BINARY_DIR}
			WORKING_DIRECTORY ${SITL_WORKING_DIR}
			USES_TERMINAL
			DEPENDS px4 flightaxis_bridge
		)
	endforeach()
endif()
```

Three details that are deliberate rather than incidental, and that the ExternalProject
boilerplate elsewhere gets wrong:

- **No `PREFIX`.** Setting `BINARY_DIR` alone puts the build exactly where `sitl_run.sh`
  looks for it (`$build_path/build_flightaxis_bridge/flightaxis_bridge`); adding `PREFIX`
  as well only creates a redundant stamp/tmp tree.
- **`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`.** The bridge has to sustain 250+ Hz SOAP round-trips.
  Without it the sub-project builds unoptimised and both Eigen and the MAVLink encoders are
  left slow. Optimising the simulation build is not optional at this frame rate.
- **`WORKING_DIRECTORY ${SITL_WORKING_DIR}`** on the run target, so the `rootfs` and logs land
  where every other PX4 SITL target puts them.

The shipped file also warns at configure time if a listed model has no
`models/<model>.json` or no matching `*_flightaxis_<model>` airframe — both are otherwise
silent misconfigurations that only surface as a Python traceback at launch. It also declares a
`flightaxis_hitl_<model>` target per model, which runs `hitl_run.sh` and **depends on
`flightaxis_bridge` only, deliberately not on `px4`**: in HITL the firmware is on a board and
there is no `px4` binary to build or run. Those targets live in this file, which is included
from `simulator_mavlink/CMakeLists.txt`, purely because this is where the `flightaxis_bridge`
ExternalProject is defined and a target cannot depend on it from elsewhere — HITL does not use
`simulator_mavlink` at all. The consequence is that you configure a `px4_sitl_nolockstep` tree
to get a HITL runner, which is odd but harmless, since nothing SITL is built or started.
`hitl_run.sh` can equally be called directly; it needs nothing from CMake beyond the binary.

### 3.1 PX4 v1.13–v1.15 — `platforms/posix/cmake/sitl_target.cmake`

**Alternative, for older trees only.** `platforms/posix/cmake/sitl_target.cmake` does not exist
in v1.16. In v1.13–v1.15 it is where every simulator was registered centrally, so there the same
three pieces are spliced into that one file instead, alongside the entries already there for
the simulators that tree ships:

```cmake
# 1. add the simulator name to the sim list
set(simulators ... flightaxis ...)

# 2. model list for target generation
set(models_flightaxis plane quad quadplane heli)

# 3. the same ExternalProject_Add(flightaxis_bridge ...) shown above

# 4. hook the runner, inside the foreach that dispatches sim runners
elseif(viewer STREQUAL "flightaxis")
	add_custom_target(${_targ_name}
		COMMAND ${PX4_SOURCE_DIR}/Tools/simulation/flightaxis/sitl_run.sh
			$<TARGET_FILE:px4> ${model} ${PX4_SOURCE_DIR} ${PX4_BINARY_DIR}
		DEPENDS px4 flightaxis_bridge
		...)
```

Exact splice points differ slightly per release — trace how an existing simulator name appears
in *your* checkout's `sitl_target.cmake` and replicate every occurrence. `install.sh` targets the
v1.16 layout only and refuses anything it does not recognise.

### 3.2 The two PX4-owned registration lines

Neither is optional, and neither is a file this repo can simply overwrite:

1. `src/modules/simulation/simulator_mavlink/CMakeLists.txt` — add
   `include(sitl_targets_flightaxis.cmake)` to the existing `include(sitl_targets_*.cmake)`
   block (alphabetical; it sorts first).
2. `ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/CMakeLists.txt` — add the four
   `120x_flightaxis_*` names inside `px4_add_romfs_files(...)`, in sorted position. **Without
   this the airframes are never packed into the ROMFS** and `make px4_sitl_nolockstep
   flightaxis_plane` starts PX4 with no matching `SYS_AUTOSTART`.

`install.sh` applies both idempotently, backing each file up first; README Method 2 gives the
manual form.

### 3.3 Bridge `CMakeLists.txt`

Same skeleton as PX4's other in-tree bridges. Eigen3 is the only external package it needs; MAVLink arrives
via the in-tree copy of `FindMAVLink.cmake`, which is why `./cmake` goes on
`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`. Abridged:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(flightaxis_bridge)
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/cmake")   # bundled FindMAVLink, see COPYRIGHT.md
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
find_package(MAVLink)
add_executable(flightaxis_bridge
	src/flightaxis_bridge.cpp
	src/px4_communicator.cpp
	src/fa_communicator.cpp
	src/vehicle_state.cpp
	src/geo_mag_declination.cpp)
target_include_directories(flightaxis_bridge BEFORE PUBLIC ${MAVLINK_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_compile_options(flightaxis_bridge PUBLIC -g -fexceptions -Wno-cast-align -Wno-address-of-packed-member)
target_link_libraries(flightaxis_bridge Eigen3::Eigen pthread)
```

Two things the shipped file adds that the sketch above omits, both for the sake of a standalone
`cmake && make` rather than the ExternalProject path:

- **It defaults `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `RelWithDebInfo`** when neither that nor
  `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` is set. The ExternalProject registration passes the build type
  explicitly, but a hand-run configure would otherwise get `-O0` Eigen quaternion maths and
  MAVLink encoders, which surfaces only as a climbing `glitches=` counter with no hint that the
  build type is the cause.
- **It turns a missing MAVLink into a `FATAL_ERROR` with instructions**, rather than leaving
  `find_package(MAVLink)` un-`REQUIRED`, as PX4's other in-tree bridges leave it. That is
  survivable for them because they are only ever configured by the ExternalProject step; here a
  miss leaves the include directory as the literal string `_MAVLINK_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND` and
  cmake fails at generate time without mentioning MAVLink at all. `FindMAVLink` looks in
  `<build dir>/../mavlink/`, so a standalone build must be configured from inside a PX4 build
  tree — which the ExternalProject step does implicitly and a hand-run cmake elsewhere does not.

---

## 4. Runner — `Tools/simulation/flightaxis/sitl_run.sh`

Follows the shape of PX4's other simulator runners, with one difference: RealFlight isn't launched (it lives on the Windows gaming box) — we only verify reachability. Abridged below. The shipped script also echoes its arguments and the SITL command; honours `DONT_RUN` and `NO_PXH` (the latter passing `-d` so the target can be driven from CI or a non-tty); invokes both Python helpers as `python3 ./script.py` rather than relying on the exec bit and shebang, which a zip round-trip or a `noexec` mount would defeat — and which would make the `||` branch misreport a working network as unreachable; and captures PX4's exit status *before* the cleanup `kill`, since otherwise a PX4 crash reports success and a clean Ctrl-C reports failure, timing-dependently:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
if [ "$#" -lt 4 ]; then echo "usage: sitl_run.sh sitl_bin model src_path build_path"; exit 1; fi

sitl_bin="$1"; model="$2"; src_path="$3"; build_path="$4"

rootfs="$build_path/rootfs"; mkdir -p "$rootfs"
export PX4_SIM_MODEL=flightaxis_${model}

# RealFlight host: env override, default localhost (RealFlight in a VM / same box)
FA_IP="${PX4_FLIGHTAXIS_IP:-127.0.0.1}"

echo "FlightAxis setup"
cd "${src_path}/Tools/simulation/flightaxis/flightaxis_bridge/"
./FA_check.py "${FA_IP}" || { echo "RealFlight FlightAxis not reachable at ${FA_IP}:18083"; exit 1; }

# Capture the bridge argv BEFORE backgrounding the bridge: substituting the
# python call straight into the command line would hide any failure, because
# empty argv makes the bridge print usage and exit, after which PX4 blocks
# forever on TCP 4560 with no diagnostic at all.
if ! fa_bridge_params=`./get_FAbridge_params.py "models/${model}.json"`; then
    echo "get_FAbridge_params.py failed for models/${model}.json" >&2
    exit 1
fi
if [ -z "$fa_bridge_params" ]; then
    echo "get_FAbridge_params.py produced no parameters for models/${model}.json" >&2
    exit 1
fi

"${build_path}/build_flightaxis_bridge/flightaxis_bridge" 0 "${FA_IP}" \
    $fa_bridge_params &
FA_BRIDGE_PID=$!

pushd "$rootfs" >/dev/null
set +e
eval "\"$sitl_bin\" \"$build_path\"/etc"
popd >/dev/null
kill $FA_BRIDGE_PID
```

Run experience:

```bash
# RealFlight running on Windows box 192.168.10.1, FlightAxis Link enabled
PX4_FLIGHTAXIS_IP=192.168.10.1 make px4_sitl_nolockstep flightaxis_plane
# QGC connects on UDP 14550 as usual
```

**Multi-instance: supported by the bridge, not reachable from `make`.** The first bridge argv is
the PX4 instance id and it does offset the listen port (`PX4Communicator::InitTcpServer()` binds
`portBase + portOffset`). But `sitl_run.sh` passes a hard-coded `0` with no environment
override, so **no `make` target can start a second instance** — a second
`flightaxis_*` target would just collide on TCP 4560. Running two aircraft at once today means
invoking the bridge binary by hand with a different instance id (and pointing each at its own
RealFlight host — one RealFlight instance serves one aircraft anyway). Threading an
`PX4_FLIGHTAXIS_INSTANCE`-style variable through `sitl_run.sh` is the obvious fix and is not
done.

---

## 5. Model JSON — the "any airframe" mechanism

`models/*.json` carries the RealFlight channel map, and `get_FAbridge_params.py` flattens it to argv — the same JSON-to-argv arrangement PX4's other in-tree bridges use for their model configuration.

Below is the **shipped `models/quadplane.json`** (comments trimmed). The `rf` and `px4` columns
are identical, and that is deliberate — see the rule that follows.

```json
{
  "Comment":   "reference-class quadplane on a RealFlight custom model",
  "RfModel":   "informational only - aircraft is selected inside RealFlight",
  "Options":   ["ResetPosition", "SilenceFPS"],
  "Channels": [
    {"rf": 0, "px4": 0, "scale": "bipolar",  "reverse": false, "comment": "aileron      <- controls[0] aileron left"},
    {"rf": 1, "px4": 1, "scale": "bipolar",  "reverse": true,  "comment": "elevator     <- controls[1]"},
    {"rf": 2, "px4": 2, "scale": "unipolar", "disarm": 0.0,    "comment": "fwd throttle <- controls[2] pusher motor"},
    {"rf": 3, "px4": 3, "scale": "bipolar",  "reverse": false, "comment": "rudder       <- controls[3]"},
    {"rf": 4, "px4": 4, "scale": "unipolar", "disarm": 0.0,    "comment": "lift motor 1 <- controls[4]"},
    {"rf": 5, "px4": 5, "scale": "unipolar", "disarm": 0.0,    "comment": "lift motor 2 <- controls[5]"},
    {"rf": 6, "px4": 6, "scale": "unipolar", "disarm": 0.0,    "comment": "lift motor 3 <- controls[6]"},
    {"rf": 7, "px4": 7, "scale": "unipolar", "disarm": 0.0,    "comment": "lift motor 4 <- controls[7]"}
  ],
  "UnmappedDefault": 0.5
}
```

**The rule: RealFlight channel N == PX4 output channel N.** Every shipped map is a pure identity
map. The JSON does not renumber anything; the ordering decision lives in the airframe, in
`PWM_MAIN_FUNC<N>` (SITL) and `HIL_ACT_FUNC<N>` (HITL) — the same place ArduPilot puts it
(`SERVOn_FUNCTION`) and the same place PX4's own Gazebo bridge puts it (`SIM_GZ_*_FUNC*`). Keeping
it there means one channel numbering runs from SITL through HITL to the physical FC pinout.

- `PWM_MAIN_FUNC<N>` in the airframe script selects which allocator output lands on
  `HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS.controls[N-1]`, so choosing the FUNC values *is* choosing the order.
- Function value `101+k` is `CA_ROTOR<k>` — **a motor, range [0,1]** → `"scale": "unipolar"`.
- Function value `201+k` is `CA_SV_CS<k>` — **a control surface, range [-1,1]** → `"scale": "bipolar"`.
- The allocator emits motors before servos, so on any mixed airframe the motors take the low
  function numbers regardless of where they sit on the RealFlight transmitter. That mismatch is
  real and still has to be absorbed somewhere — it is absorbed by the FUNC list. It is exactly why
  the quadplane's `PWM_MAIN_FUNC1..9` are the scattered `201, 203, 105, 204, 101, 102, 103, 104,
  202` rather than `101..104, 105, 201..204`: the RealFlight model wants aileron, elevator,
  throttle, rudder, then the four lift motors, which is the conventional channel order for this
  class, and the FUNCs deliver `controls[]` in exactly that order.
- If a user's RealFlight model has a different channel order, the fix is to change
  `PWM_MAIN_FUNC<N>` to match it and keep the JSON identity — **not** to scramble the JSON.

Each shipped airframe script carries this derivation as a comment block next to its
`PWM_MAIN_FUNC*` lines; that block and the JSON must still agree, and a disagreement silently
drives the wrong actuator. The other three models:

| Model | RealFlight channel order | `PWM_MAIN_FUNC1..N` | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plane` | aileron, elevator, throttle, rudder | `201, 203, 101, 204, 202` | `FUNC5` parks aileron right (Servo 2) on the spare `controls[4]`, unmapped |
| `quad` | motors 1–4 | `101, 102, 103, 104` | the one all-motor airframe, so the allocator order is already the RealFlight order |
| `quadplane` | aileron, elevator, throttle, rudder, lift 1–4 | `201, 203, 105, 204, 101, 102, 103, 104, 202` | as above; `FUNC9` parks aileron right on `controls[8]` |
| `heli` | swash 1–3, tail, (5–7 idle), main | `202, 203, 204, 201, 0, 0, 0, 101` | `CA_AIRFRAME 11` numbers motors first, then servos — main rotor = Motor 1 = 101, yaw tail = Servo 1 = 201, swash = Servos 2–4 = 202–204 — and the FUNCs reorder those onto **ArduPilot's heli channel order**: swash on rf0–2, tail on rf3, RSC on rf7, rf4–6 idle. Ground truth: `AP_MotorsHeli_Swash.cpp:201-202` (swash → `SERVO1/2/3`, `k_motor1/2/3`), `AP_MotorsHeli_Single.cpp:207` (`add_motor_num(CH_4)`, tail → `SERVO4`), `AP_MotorsHeli.h:34` (`#define AP_MOTORS_HELI_RSC CH_8`, `k_heli_rsc` = 31) |

Three heli-specific traps, all documented inside `heli.json`:

- **The tail rotor is bipolar**, with `"disarm": 0.5`. Under `CA_AIRFRAME 11` ("Helicopter (tail
  Servo)") the yaw tail is a *servo* on `[-1,1]`, and 0.5 on the wire is zero tail pitch — which
  is what the collective-pitch tail rotor of nearly every stock RealFlight single-rotor heli
  wants. `CA_AIRFRAME 10` ("tail ESC") would make it a motor clamped to `[0,1]`, clipping the
  entire negative half of the yaw command: measured through the bridge, yaw −3 rad/s produced
  `rf3 = 0.000` with the tail on its lower stop, i.e. **no left yaw authority at all**. Type 10
  is only right for a heli with a separate unidirectional electric tail motor.
- **Every row needs an explicit `"disarm"`**, including the swash servos. This is belt-and-braces
  now that `HeliDemix` is off by default — the swash rows are plain pass-through and nothing
  rewrites them after the fact, so holding would be safe on that ground alone. The rule stays
  enforced so that *re-enabling* the demix for a CCPM model cannot quietly reintroduce the
  hazard: when applied as a post-pass over the built channel array, a row on the `-1` "hold last
  output" default would have its already-demixed value re-demixed on the next frame. That
  iteration is a non-involutive linear map and diverges: from a plausible in-flight swash it
  rails within about three frames. Neutral is a fixed point, so it only shows up on the
  armed→disarmed transition with the swash deflected — every landing — and nothing is logged.
  (The bridge additionally transforms out of a scratch copy, so holding is safe today either
  way; nothing in a model JSON can tell whether that is still true.)
- **Swash mixing lives in exactly one place, and that place is PX4.** `heli.json` ships without
  `HeliDemix`, so the allocator's three swash servo positions reach RealFlight untouched and the
  RealFlight model must be wired non-mixed / direct-servo. Two mixes in series compose rather
  than cancel, cross-coupling roll and pitch. This also matches ArduPilot's default, where the
  demix is opt-in via a `helidemix` substring in the frame name
  (`SIM_FlightAxis.cpp:129-130`). Re-enable it only for a CCPM model whose mixing cannot be
  turned off — an **untested path**, since with the demix off neither its arithmetic nor the
  decoupling argument for the pinned geometry is exercised.
- **When enabled, `HeliDemix` only inverts correctly for the swash geometry the airframe forces**
  via `CA_SP0_ANG*` = 300/60/180, with equal arm lengths and `CA_MAX_SVO_THROW 0` (§12). With the
  demix off those angles instead describe the **physical** head of the RealFlight model.

- `px4` = index into `HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS.controls[]`, which the airframe's `PWM_MAIN_FUNC*` assignments populate and the QGC Actuators tab displays. On every shipped model it equals `rf`; what varies between models is the FUNC list, not this column.
- Scaling: `unipolar` = clamp(v,0,1) for motors (HIL controls are 0..1 for motors); `bipolar` = (v+1)/2 for surfaces (−1..1). Net effect is the same as normalising a 1000–2000 µs PWM band to 0..1. `reverse` is applied *after* scaling, as `v -> 1-v`.
- `disarm` = the value sent while PX4 is disarmed or the control is NaN. **`disarm: -1` (also the default when the key is absent) means "hold the last output"** rather than driving the channel anywhere — right for a plain control surface, wrong for a motor, which is why every motor row states `"disarm": 0.0` explicitly, and wrong for any row an option post-pass rewrites, which is why every row in `heli.json` states one (see the heli traps above).
- **Duplicate indices are rejected at startup, not tolerated.** Two rows sharing an `rf` index would silently last-wins in `buildChannels()`, and a repeated `px4` index is almost always a typo, so the bridge refuses to start on either and names the two offending entries.
- `UnmappedDefault` is the value sent on every RealFlight channel the map does not mention.
- `Options` (a bit per option, flattened to a bitmask by `get_FAbridge_params.py`): `ResetPosition` (=1, ResetAircraft on startup, default), `Rev4Servos` (=2, swap ch1–4 ↔ 5–8 wholesale for RF models built that way — do **not** enable it on a model whose FUNC params already produce the right order, such as the quadplane, since it can only swap a correct order into a wrong one), `HeliDemix` (=4, **not enabled on any shipped model**; swash servos → RF roll/pitch/collective: `roll=(s1−s2)/1.732`, `pitch=((s1+s2)/2−s3)/1.5`, `col=(s1+s2+s3)/3`, recentered 0..1 — the divisors are gain normalisation, see below — for CCPM RealFlight models whose own mixing cannot be disabled), `SilenceFPS` (=8). All four shipped models flatten to **9** (`ResetPosition|SilenceFPS`).
- **The `HeliDemix` gain normalisation.** The geometric inverse alone is not unit-gain. `buildChannels()` maps each bipolar swash servo to `(v+1)/2` before the post-pass runs, and with the pinned 300/60/180 geometry that leaves `s1−s2` at gain 0.866 and `(s1+s2)/2−s3` at 0.750, against the 0.5 about a 0.5 centre that RealFlight wants for a full-scale command. Undivided, the cyclic saturates at ±0.577 of commanded roll torque and ±0.667 of pitch, roll hotter than pitch. So roll is divided by 0.866/0.5 = √3 = 1.732 and pitch by 0.750/0.5 = 1.5. **Not** by 0.866 and 0.750: that recovers raw torque and clips at half command. Collective, `(s1+s2+s3)/3`, is already exactly gain 0.5 and is deliberately untouched. The constants are only valid for the pinned geometry — changing `CA_SP0_ANG*` or the arm lengths invalidates them. **These divisors are ours and ArduPilot has no equivalent:** `SIM_FlightAxis.cpp:348-350` is a plain unweighted inverse, exact only for a 140° head (`AP_MotorsHeli_Swash.cpp:138-145` mixes `H3_140` with flat ±1.0 factors). On the 120° head both projects actually use — `AP_MotorsHeli_Swash.cpp:147-154` defaults `add_servo_angle` to −60/+60/180, the same geometry as our `CA_SP0_ANG` 300/60/180 — ArduPilot's forward mixer carries cos 30° = 0.866 on roll against 0.5/1.0 on pitch, so its own round trip returns roll and pitch gains in the ratio 2/√3 = 1.155 rather than 1. Matching ArduPilot here would reintroduce that imbalance. **The channel order follows ArduPilot; the demix gains deliberately do not.**
- **Both post-passes read a scratch copy, not the persistent channel array.** `channels[]` holds the untransformed per-channel state so that hold-last has something stable to hold; `out[]` is what goes to RealFlight. Transforming in place would re-transform every hold-last channel every frame — `HeliDemix` diverges, and `Rev4Servos`, whose swap is its own inverse, instead ping-pongs a held channel between `rf i` and `rf i+4` on alternate frames, a full-amplitude servo buzz at loop rate.
- Adding a new aircraft takes **four** steps, not three: new JSON, one model name in the `models` list in `sitl_targets_flightaxis.cmake`, one airframe script — and that airframe must also be added to `ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/CMakeLists.txt` (§3.2) or it never reaches the ROMFS.

RealFlight model prep (once per aircraft, in the RF editor): strip expo/mixes/gyros, max servo speed, one channel per actuator.

## 6. Frame Conversions — verified against the upstream FlightAxis implementation

These go in `vehicle_state.cpp`. They are line-for-line what the upstream implementation named in `COPYRIGHT.md` ships — not inferred. RealFlight's conventions are internally inconsistent (position swapped, velocity not); follow literally.

**Quaternion (RF → NED):** `q_ned = (w=W, x=RF_Y, y=RF_X, z=−RF_Z)` — swap X↔Y, negate Z.

**Gyro:** `p=+roll_rate, q=+pitch_rate, r=−yaw_rate` (deg→rad, constrain ±2000 °/s). **Only yaw negated.**

**Position (NED):** `(N=RF_Y, E=RF_X, D=−altASL)`. Capture `position_offset` on first frame and after every `m-resetButtonHasBeenPressed`; subtract it so PX4's home (bridge argv / `PX4_HOME_*`) anchors the RF world. NED→LLA for HIL_GPS.

**World velocity:** `(vN=U, vE=V, vD=W)` — **used directly, no swap** (asymmetric with position; it's what works).

**Wind:** swapped like position: `(windY, windX, windZ)`.

**Accelerometer (specific force):** in flight use `m-accelerationBodyA*` directly. On ground it's garbage — RealFlight's ground-contact accelerometer output is noisy enough to prevent a helicopter disarming — so override:

```cpp
if (touching_ground) {
    // dt_true, NOT the glitch-capped dt: a swallowed glitch would divide the
    // real velocity change by a shorter interval and overstate the accel
    accel_ef  = (velocity_ef - last_velocity_ef) / dt_true;
    accel_ef.z -= 9.80665f;
    accel_body = R_ned_to_body * accel_ef;      // yields exactly (0,0,-g) at rest
}
clamp(accel_body, ±16 g);
```

**Pitot airspeed — computed, not read:** `m_airspeed_MPS` is total TAS; a pitot wants body-X:

```cpp
airspeed_pitot = max( (R_ned_to_body * (velocity_ef - wind_ef)).x , 0 );
diff_pressure  = 0.5f * 1.225f * airspeed_pitot * airspeed_pitot / 100.0f;   // Pa -> hPa
```

Critical for 3D/high-alpha models — total airspeed lies during hover/harrier/knife-edge.

**Pressure units are hPa, not Pa.** Both `HIL_SENSOR.abs_pressure` and `HIL_SENSOR.diff_pressure`
are hectopascals in MAVLink, so the `/100` above is not cosmetic — dropping it feeds PX4 an
airspeed error of a factor of 10. Both are declared as hPa in `vehicle_state.h`.

**Rangefinder:** `AGL / dcm.c.z` when `dcm.c.z > 0`, else invalid (inverted). This is not
computed and discarded: when valid it is packed into a `DISTANCE_SENSOR` message and sent to PX4
at 20 Hz (§8.2), which is what makes terrain-relative modes and landing usable.

**Magnetometer:** WMM field at home via `geo_mag_declination.cpp` (bundled verbatim, see `COPYRIGHT.md`), rotated to body with the quaternion above.

**Barometer:** ISA, `p = 101325·(1 − 2.25577e-5·h)^5.25588` Pa, converted to **hPa**. Temp ~25 °C.

The altitude `h` fed into that formula is **deliberately not RealFlight's ASL**. It is
`h = home_alt − position_ned.z()` — the same datum `nedToLLA()` uses for the GPS altitude it
reports. The reason is that a RealFlight runway sits at
whatever arbitrary ASL its scenery author chose, which has nothing to do with the home altitude
PX4 was given. Deriving baro from RF ASL while deriving GPS from `home_alt` would present EKF2
with a *constant* baro-vs-GPS height disagreement — the estimator would either fight it forever
or reject one of the two sources. Anchoring both to the same datum makes the two agree by
construction; the cost is that the baro no longer encodes the scenery's real elevation, which
nothing downstream cares about.

---

## 7. Timing — extrapolation & glitch handling

RealFlight free-runs (~250 Hz). Upsampling alone is enough to dodge PX4's stale-sensor detection, but not enough to survive duplicate frames, network glitches and a simulator that stops producing physics altogether; the bridge uses a four-branch scheme, keyed on `m-currentPhysicsTime-SEC`:

0. **leaving a keep-alive** (physics time has advanced past the last frame we consumed, and a keep-alive was running) → re-base the epoch onto the clock already exported, so the next frame resumes at exactly the clock PX4 last saw, and skip glitch compensation for this frame. See below.
1. **dt < 0** → RealFlight restarted: re-base initial time, zero position offset, continue.
2. **dt < 1e-5 s** (same physics frame — bridge outran RF): do **not** resend an identical HIL_SENSOR. Extrapolate in 1 ms steps (propagate attitude by `q⊗exp(½ω·δt)`, hold accel/gyro), never beyond `average_frame_time` (EMA `0.98/0.02`).
3. **normal frame** → full pipeline, then glitch compensation: if physics time jumped 50 ms–2 s (network hiccup), swallow the excess by advancing the epoch (`initial_time += dt − 50 ms`), cap dt at 50 ms, count the glitch. Backwards >500 ms = true reset, accept.

Timestamps in HIL messages = physics time (µs since epoch capture). Watch `m-currentPhysicsSpeedMultiplier ≠ 1` → warn. Print the FPS line every 1000 frames.

**The wall-clock keep-alive**, and why branch 0 exists to unwind it. Two situations stop
RealFlight's physics clock while PX4 still needs a sensor stream: the controller reinject after
a spacebar reset or an aircraft change, and a *stalled* clock — sim paused, a modal dialog open,
the window minimised, with `ExchangeData` still returning valid replies carrying the same
`m-currentPhysicsTime-SEC` over and over. From the bridge both look identical, a good frame with
no new physics in it, so both get the same treatment: hold the last state, advance the exported
clock off **wall** time at ~1 kHz, and keep sending. A single step is capped at 100 ms so a long
stall cannot teleport the clock forward.

The stall is only declared after 200 ms, and that threshold is load-bearing in both directions.
Arriving at "no new frame" is *normal* once per frame — the loop free-runs at several kHz against
a 250 Hz simulator and routinely finishes interpolating with time to spare — so too low a
threshold makes branch 0 re-base on nearly every real frame, which measurably consumed most of
them and left the realtime-factor monitor permanently reading `n/a`. Too high and PX4's sensor
topics go stale, since the arming checks want each one updated within 1 s. 200 ms sits an order
of magnitude above any plausible frame period (4 ms at 250 Hz, 20 ms even at a badly degraded
50 Hz) and comfortably under that 1 s timeout.

Sending nothing was the original behaviour and it was worse. Measured against the mock with a
6 s freeze: HIL_SENSOR stopped about 52 ms into the stall, and PX4 went on to log `MAG #0 failed:
TIMEOUT`, `BARO #0 failed: TIMEOUT` and `angular velocity no longer valid (timeout)`, failing
every sensor arming check — and the whole stall was later applied to the clock as one 6 s jump,
silently, since that exceeds the 2 s glitch ceiling.

Branch 0 is what keeps the two clocks from drifting apart afterwards. The keep-alive advances
the exported clock while the physics epoch stands still, so by the time real frames resume the
two disagree by the length of the stall. Falling straight through to branch 3 would compute the
new time from that stale epoch: diverged backwards, the monotonic clamp **freezes** the exported
clock, and because the offset is constant — physics resumes exactly where it paused — it never
self-corrects and stays frozen for the rest of the session. A frozen clock is severe even in
SITL, where PX4 discards our timestamps anyway, because every send-rate gate is measured against
it: HIL_GPS, DISTANCE_SENSOR and the baro/mag sub-rates stop being sent at all and only the
ungated HIL_SENSOR survives. Re-basing the epoch onto the clock already exported removes both the
freeze and the jump. The upstream implementation the other three branches were ported from has
no wall-clock keep-alive and so never meets any of this: branch 0 and the keep-alive are
original to this bridge, which is why the provenance notices still describe a *three*-branch
port.

The reinject itself is throttled to one attempt per 300 ms, separately from the keep-alive:
`startController()` is three SOAP round-trips *including* `ResetAircraft`, and the branch is
entered thousands of times a second while the flag is low.

**Realtime-factor monitor.** The branches above keep the bridge's *exported* clock clean,
which is necessary and not sufficient. PX4 timestamps the SITL sensor stream with its own clock
on arrival (`SimulatorMavlink::handle_message_hil_sensor`), not with the physics time carried in
the message, so what actually reaches EKF2 is the wall-clock arrival rate. If RealFlight's
physics falls behind wall time, PX4 integrates the vehicle's motion over more real time than the
physics covered: the aircraft flies in slow motion while every sensor value looks perfectly
correct, and velocities, accelerations and every control loop are scaled wrong. Nothing in the
sensor data reveals it, and the glitch compensation actively hides it, because it smooths the
exported clock rather than the arrival rate. The bridge therefore measures physics seconds per
wall second over each reporting window, prints it as `rtf=` in the FPS line, and warns (rate
limited to once per 5 s) outside 0.95–1.05. This is distinct from the
`m-currentPhysicsSpeedMultiplier` warning, which is RealFlight's *self-reported setting*: the
realtime factor catches RealFlight reporting 1.0 and the machine failing to keep up. One sample
is suppressed after a keep-alive, where the physics clock was paused on purpose.

## 8. Bridge Internals

### 8.1 `fa_communicator` — SOAP client

- **New TCP connection per request**, latency hidden by a background *socket-creator thread* that always has the next connected socket parked (100 ms connect timeout, condition-variable handoff). This, not keep-alive, is the pattern RealFlight's SOAP endpoint actually tolerates: it closes the connection after each reply.
- Reply read: find `Content-Length`, drain to `\r\n\r\n`+length, close socket.
- Parser: sequential `strstr` scan over the key table **in document order** (12 `item` echoes first, then all `m-*` fields), `true/false→1/0`, `atof`. Any missing key → flag re-init (schema/version change self-heals).
- Startup sequence (exact order): `RestoreOriginalControllerDevice` → (`ResetAircraft` if ResetPosition) → `InjectUAVControllerInterface`.
- Re-run startup whenever no socket AND (`!controller_started` OR `m-flightAxisControllerIsActive==0` OR `m-resetButtonHasBeenPressed`) — makes aircraft-change and spacebar in RealFlight self-heal.
- `m-selectedChannels`: send **0 until PX4 is up** (first HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS received), then 4095. RealFlight holds neutral meanwhile.

### 8.2 `px4_communicator`

TCP server on 4560+instance; PX4 (`simulator_mavlink`) connects. Receives `HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS`
(armed flag in `mode`; NaN/disarmed → JSON `disarm` values).

`Send()` runs at the full RealFlight frame rate plus every 1 ms extrapolation step (§7), which is
far faster than most of these messages need. Only `HIL_SENSOR` genuinely wants that rate, so
everything else is decimated against the bridge's own physics clock; the interval constants and
the dispatch both live in `px4_communicator`. One of each is forced out on the first frame so
PX4 has a complete picture immediately:

| Message | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HIL_SENSOR` | every frame / extrapolation step (~1 kHz) | pressures in hPa (§6); `fields_updated` sub-rated, below |
| `HIL_GPS` | **10 Hz** (`GPS_INTERVAL_US`) | COG = `atan2(vE,vN)`, **not** RF azimuth. PX4 publishes one `sensor_gps` per message with no rate limiting of its own, hence the decimation |
| `HIL_STATE_QUATERNION` | **50 Hz** (`STATE_QUAT_INTERVAL_US`) | ground truth only — for log analysis, not consumed by the estimator |
| `DISTANCE_SENSOR` | **20 Hz** (`DISTANCE_INTERVAL_US`) | built by `VehicleState::getDistanceSensorMsg()`; downward-facing (`PITCH_270`), 0.1–40 m, cm units. **Gated on `rangefinderValid()`** — suppressed entirely while the aircraft is inverted rather than sent as a bogus reading |
| `RAW_RPM` | every frame | index 0, from RealFlight's prop/rotor RPM. No PX4 handler exists, so this is wasted bandwidth on any link where bandwidth is not free; the HITL profile drops it |

**Sub-rates *within* `HIL_SENSOR`.** `vehicle_state` builds every message with
`fields_updated = 0x1FFF` — "every sensor is new" — and `px4_communicator` then masks that
bitmask down on the way out. Accel and gyro are never masked and follow the full `HIL_SENSOR`
rate; the magnetometer (100 Hz), barometer (50 Hz) and differential pressure (50 Hz) are masked
out between their own intervals. This applies **in SITL as well as HITL**, which is why the
intervals are not zero by default. The motivation on a real board is CPU and fidelity: 250 Hz of
baro and mag into an MCU whose real drivers would run them at 50–100 Hz misrepresents the sensor
suite to the estimator. In SITL it is log volume: `SimulatorMavlink::update_sensors()` publishes
`sensor_baro` *twice* for every message carrying the BARO bits, plus mag and differential
pressure once each, so at the ~1 kHz rate `Send()` runs the baro went out at roughly 20× and the
mag and pitot at 10× their intended rates — surplus that `VehicleAirData` drains and averages
away after inflating every ulog for nothing.

Two details make this fiddlier than it looks. The masks are **all-bits-equal** tests, not
any-bit: `BARO` needs bits 9, 11 and 12 together. And bit 12 is what latches
`_sensors_temperature`, which accel, gyro and mag then read — so `BARO` must never be masked out
of the *first* message. It is not: a `sent_first` flag backdates every interval timer so message
one carries the full `0x1FFF`.

**A dead PX4 link is terminal.** PX4 can vanish silently — the SITL binary exits, a USB cable is
pulled, a board reboots — after which every send fails. The bridge does not retry: once the link
is declared lost the communicator stops sending, `LinkLost()` latches, and the main loop breaks
out and exits cleanly, which stops the SOAP traffic as a consequence. The alternative is
thousands of log lines a second and continued hammering of RealFlight for a simulation nobody is
consuming, and on serial up to 100 ms burnt in `poll(POLLOUT)` per failed frame. Reconnecting is
deliberately not attempted either: for the TCP server that would mean re-`accept()`ing a fresh
PX4 whose clock starts at zero while the bridge's has not, and the supervisor that started both
sides is the right place to restart the pair. Detection is `POLLHUP`/`POLLERR`/`POLLNVAL`, a
zero-length TCP read, a fatal `send()` errno, or 100 consecutive send failures — the last of
which catches the serial `POLLOUT`-timeout case, which has no distinguishing errno. **UDP has no
such signal at all**; a datagram to a dead board succeeds forever. That is inherent to the
transport, not an omission.

**HITL transports.** Beyond the SITL TCP server, `px4_communicator` also offers a serial client
and a UDP client, selected by `PX4_HITL_TRANSPORT`, together with a HITL message profile that
decimates `HIL_SENSOR`, drops `HIL_STATE_QUATERNION` and `RAW_RPM`, and adds a `HEARTBEAT`.
`HIL_STATE_QUATERNION` matters most: in SITL it is ground truth for logging, but a real board
*consumes* it and republishes straight onto EKF2's own output topics. Full treatment, including
the bandwidth budget and the `_datarate > 5000` gate, is in [`HITL.md`](HITL.md).

**RC passthrough — NOT IMPLEMENTED (future work).** The 12 `item` values echoed in every
ExchangeData reply *are* the physical InterLink TX channels, and the bridge does parse them into
`FAState.rcin[12]` — but nothing ever reads that array, and no
`HIL_RC_INPUTS_RAW` is constructed or sent anywhere in the bridge. **You cannot currently fly PX4
Manual/Acro from the RealFlight transmitter.** The data is one short function away from being
usable, which is why the field is populated; if it is wired up, note that the InterLink sends
ch2 inverted relative to what PX4 expects, so expect to reverse it in RC calibration.

### 8.3 Main loop

```
take parked socket → ExchangeData(channels) → parse
branch on dt (§7) → convert (§6) → HIL_SENSOR [+GPS/GT on schedule]
drain 4560 (non-blocking) → latest HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS → JSON channel map → next channels
```

Loop rate is set by RealFlight's SOAP RTT (~2–5 ms → 200–500 Hz). Wired network or same-host only; WiFi cannot hold 200 Hz.

## 9. Airframe Script Example — `1200_flightaxis_plane`

**Heavily abridged — this is the shape, not a working airframe.** The four real scripts run
44–108 lines each, and the bulk of that is the actuator geometry (`CA_AIRFRAME`, `CA_ROTOR*`,
`CA_SV_CS*`, `PWM_MAIN_FUNC*`) plus per-vehicle tuning, none of which is optional. Read the
shipped files — `ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/120{0,1,2,3}_flightaxis_*` — before
writing a new one; each carries a comment block deriving its `PWM_MAIN_FUNC*` values from the
allocator's own numbering, which is where the channel order is decided and which must stay in
step with the matching `models/<name>.json` — an identity map (§5).

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# @name FlightAxis Plane
# @type Plane
. ${R}etc/init.d/rc.fw_defaults

# RealFlight free-runs (no lockstep), GPS samples arrive fresh.
param set EKF2_GPS_DELAY 0
param set EKF2_MULTI_IMU 1
param set-default SDLOG_MODE 4
param set-default COM_RC_IN_MODE 4

# ... 60 more lines: CA_* geometry, PWM_MAIN_FUNC* assignments, per-vehicle tuning ...
```

**`param set` versus `param set-default`.** The first two use a plain `param set` deliberately,
because `px4-rc.mavlinksim` runs *after* the airframe script and issues its own
`param set-default` for both, which would quietly win over a default set here. A plain
`param set` takes precedence and survives. The rest are `set-default`, so a user's saved value
still wins. What each is for:

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `EKF2_GPS_DELAY` | `0` | RealFlight free-runs and the synthesised GPS samples are current, with none of the transport delay the 10 ms default compensates for. |
| `EKF2_MULTI_IMU` | `1` | The bridge sends `HIL_SENSOR` with `id = 0` only, so `SimulatorMavlink` only ever fills IMU instance 0. `px4-rc.mavlinksim` asks for 3, leaving two EKF instances running on dead sensors. `0` is not an alternative — EKF2 clamps this to a minimum of 1 when `SENS_IMU_MODE` is 0. |
| `SDLOG_MODE` | `4` | `rcS` sets 1, "from boot until disarm", which closes the log at the *first* disarm. The §11 checklist spans several arm/disarm cycles, so most of it — including the groundtruth-versus-estimate comparison — would never reach a log. 4 is "from first arm until shutdown". `@reboot_required`, so it has to be a startup default rather than a `pxh>` command. |
| `COM_RC_IN_MODE` | `4` | A headless run has no manual control source at all, and 4 ("ignore any stick input") is the only value that skips the RC-loss failsafe. `NAV_RCL_ACT` is deliberately left alone: it is unreachable once this is 4, and the value usually suggested for it is outside the parameter's declared range. |

**Rotor geometry: the symmetry matters, the magnitudes do not.** This was an open question and
is now settled. PX4 normalises the multirotor mixing matrix by a scale derived from the mix
columns themselves (`ControlAllocationPseudoInverse`), so the arm length divides straight back
out: a ±0.15 m square, a ±0.25 m square and a ±0.50 m square produce a bit-identical matrix for
any `KM` and `CT`, all of them ±0.7071 per motor — the cos(45°) values a quad-X frame table
would give directly. **So `CA_ROTOR*_P[XY]` needs no adjustment per RealFlight model, and no doc
should suggest measuring it.** What is *not* free is asymmetry: feed asymmetric arms to a
symmetric aircraft and roll and pitch stay clean while yaw cross-couples — with the asymmetric
arms of PX4's stock standard-VTOL airframe (PY 0.245 / -0.1875), a unit yaw command also
produces a 53 % roll disturbance. That figure comes from working the allocator's mixing matrix
through by hand, not from a flight — it is a property of the pseudo-inverse and needs no
simulator to reproduce — and it is structural, so no rate tuning removes it. The symmetric
square in the shipped airframes is therefore a deliberate choice, not a placeholder awaiting
real numbers.

## 10. Implementation Order (each step testable)

1. Lay out the bridge folder; bring in `px4_communicator` and `geo_mag_declination`; stub out the sim-side communicator.
2. `fa_communicator`: standalone test against RealFlight — print physics time ≥200 FPS. (No PX4 involved yet.)
3. `vehicle_state` conversions → HIL_SENSOR; run PX4, check `listener sensor_accel` / QGC attitude mirrors RealFlight.
4. Actuator path: QGC Actuators sliders move RF surfaces through the JSON map.
5. Timing hardening (§7) + reconnect state machine.
6. Options (Rev4/HeliDemix), remaining model JSONs, `sitl_targets_flightaxis.cmake` polish. (RC passthrough was planned here and is not done — §8.2.)

## 11. Validation Checklist

1. **Static:** level on runway → accel (0,0,−9.81) with zero jitter (proves ground override), gyro 0, heading = RF compass; nose-up 90° clean (quaternion path, no Euler singularity).
2. **Rates:** roll right p>0, pull up q>0, yaw right r>0 (only yaw negated from RF).
3. **Taxi** north/east → local N/E and vN/vE track; QGC map mirrors RF world.
4. **High alpha:** hover a 3D model → pitot ≈ 0 while `m_airspeed` isn't (proves §6 pitot).
5. **EKF:** innovations bounded over a manual circuit; groundtruth-vs-estimate in ulog.
6. **Resilience:** spacebar in RF (auto re-inject + re-offset), aircraft change in RF (auto restart), 1 s network pull (glitch counter++, no EKF time-jump fault), kill bridge mid-flight (PX4 sensor-timeout failsafe, not a hang).

### Validation status

The six items above are the *target*. This is where they actually stand. The distinction matters
because RealFlight is Windows-only and no Windows machine has been in the loop yet. (README.md
carries the same status in shorter form; keep the two in step.)

**Not one of the six items has been closed against RealFlight.** Everything below marked
verified was observed against a **mock FlightAxis server** — a local SOAP responder replaying
the RealFlight schema, with no flight dynamics: it returns a fixed aircraft state whatever
actuator values it is given. That is enough to exercise the software path end to end and nothing
more. No aircraft has ever flown.

**Verified against the mock:**

- The bridge builds, and the `flightaxis_{plane,quad,quadplane,heli}` and
  `flightaxis_hitl_{plane,quad,quadplane,heli}` make targets exist and resolve.
- All four model JSONs flatten cleanly through `get_FAbridge_params.py`.
- `FA_check.py` fails correctly, with its diagnostic, against an unreachable host.
- **End to end:** PX4 connects on TCP 4560, EKF2 converges, and the synthesised sensors are
  sane — in particular baro and GPS altitudes agree, confirming the shared-datum choice in §6.
- Channel maps correct end to end for **plane and quad**, including bipolar/reverse/unipolar
  scaling and the disarm values.
- The resilience cases (item 6): reconnect, aircraft reset, glitch swallow, and sim death all
  behave as §7 and §8.1 describe.
- The ROS 2 path, including offboard mode accepted from ROS 2 and driving the actuators through
  to the simulator. Because the mock has no dynamics, this establishes that the commands are
  wired through, **not** that the aircraft flies to a setpoint ([`ROS2.md`](ROS2.md)).

**Verified without hardware, for HITL:** the serial transport over a PTY pair, the framing, the
message profile and rates, and `hitl_run.sh`'s guards. A PTY has no baud rate, so real UART
timing is untested. [`HITL.md`](HITL.md) §11 is the authority; nothing there has touched a
physical board.

**Still requires a real Windows RealFlight machine** — untested, and not to be presented otherwise:

- Item 2, the rate sign conventions (roll/pitch/yaw polarity out of RealFlight).
- Item 3, taxi N/E tracking against the RF world.
- Item 4, high-alpha pitot behaviour.
- The compass-heading and nose-up-90° parts of item 1.
- Item 5 — no circuit has been flown, so EKF innovation bounds over a real manoeuvre are unknown.
- The quadplane and heli channel maps beyond static reasoning, and `HeliDemix` against a real swash.
- The heli rate gains, collective curve and yaw compensation (§9, §12). They are generic
  collective-pitch values and the blade angles are a property of the RealFlight model, so they
  are a starting point to refine in Acro, not a tune.

## 12. Pitfalls Ledger

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Lockstep vs free-running RF | use the existing `px4_sitl_nolockstep` target |
| Duplicate physics frames → zero-dt sensors | §7 branch 2 extrapolation |
| Network hiccup → EKF time jump | 50 ms glitch swallow |
| Ground-contact accel noise | finite-difference override (§6) |
| Pitot fed total airspeed | body-X from velocity−wind (§6) |
| Position swapped, velocity not, wind swapped | §6 literally |
| Channels sent before PX4 ready | selectedChannels 0 → 4095 after first actuator msg |
| Aircraft change / spacebar mid-session | reconnect state machine (§8.1) |
| Keep-alive assumption | per-request sockets + creator thread (§8.1) |
| **Baro-vs-GPS datum mismatch** — RF runway sits at an arbitrary scenery ASL, so baro from RF ASL disagrees with GPS from `home_alt` by a constant, forever | derive both from `home_alt − position_ned.z` (§6) |
| **Pressures sent in Pa** — MAVLink `HIL_SENSOR` wants hPa | `/100` on both `abs_pressure` and `diff_pressure` (§6) |
| **`EKF2_GPS_DELAY` and `EKF2_MULTI_IMU` silently clobbered** — `px4-rc.mavlinksim` runs after the airframe and re-defaults both | use `param set`, not `param set-default`, for those two (§9) |
| **RC-loss failsafe on a headless run** — no joystick, no RC, no manual control source at all | `COM_RC_IN_MODE 4`, the only value that skips the check (§9) |
| **Log closes at the first disarm**, so a multi-cycle validation session is mostly unlogged | `SDLOG_MODE 4` (§9) |
| **Heli swash mixing applied twice** — PX4's allocator mixes, and the RealFlight model's own CCPM mixes again; the two compose rather than cancel and roll/pitch cross-couple in flight, with nothing logged | put the mix in exactly one place: `HeliDemix` off in `heli.json` (default) and the RealFlight model wired non-mixed / direct-servo (§5) |
| **Heli cyclic response is rotated** — `CA_SP0_ANG*` does not match the model's actual head, so a pitch command banks the aircraft | force 300/60/180 in `1203_flightaxis_heli` (120° head, odd servo aft, ArduPilot's default) and pin the arm lengths and `CA_MAX_SVO_THROW 0`; use 120/240/0 for an odd-servo-forward head. Only confirmable in flight. |
| **Heli has no left yaw** — under `CA_AIRFRAME 10` the tail is a *motor* clamped to `[0,1]`, so the whole negative half of the yaw command is clipped and the tail sits on its lower stop | `CA_AIRFRAME 11` (tail Servo), with `rf3` `bipolar` and `disarm` 0.5 in `heli.json` (§5) |
| **Heli demix over-drives the cyclic** — the raw differences are gain 0.866 / 0.750, not 0.5, so roll saturates at 0.577 of command and pitch at 0.667, roll hotter than pitch | divide roll by √3 and pitch by 1.5 in the bridge's `HeliDemix` post-pass (§5). *Fixed — this was a known defect in earlier drafts and is not one now.* |
| **Heli hold-last swash re-demixed every frame**, diverging within ~3 frames on the armed→disarmed transition | every `heli.json` row carries an explicit `disarm`, and the post-passes read a scratch copy rather than the persistent channel array (§5) |
| **Motor-failure detection does not work in SITL** — `SimulatorMavlink` reports 1–16 A per ESC while armed, and the undercurrent test `1 + 15c < 2c` has no solution for any throttle | nothing to fix, and nothing to suppress: the quadplane's inherited `FD_ACT_EN 0` / `FD_ACT_MOT_TOUT 500` were suppressing a detector that cannot fire, so they were **removed**. Left at firmware defaults, detection starts working if upstream fixes the SITL ESC current model. Corollary: no motor-failure detection in SITL today, for any vehicle. |
| **Rotor arm lengths treated as a per-model measurement** — they are not; the allocator normalises the magnitudes away and only the symmetry pattern survives | keep the symmetric square; never "correct" it towards a reference airframe's measured arms (§9) |
| **Dead PX4 link retried forever** — thousands of log lines a second and continued SOAP load for a simulation nobody consumes | a dead link is terminal: stop sending, latch, exit cleanly (§8.2) |
| **Silent channel-map typo** — duplicate `rf` last-wins, duplicate `px4` is a typo | bridge refuses to start and names both entries (§5) |
| **Physics falling behind wall time, invisibly** — PX4 timestamps on arrival, so the vehicle flies in slow motion with entirely correct-looking sensor values | realtime-factor monitor, printed as `rtf=` and warned outside 0.95–1.05 (§7) |
| WiFi to RealFlight | wired / same host only |
| Bridge lives on wrong side | run bridge on (or wired-adjacent to) the RealFlight machine; SOAP RTT dominates — MAVLink to PX4 tolerates more latency |

### 12.1 Not implemented

Three things earlier drafts of this ledger listed as solved. They are not, and nothing downstream
should assume them:

- **RC passthrough.** `rcin[12]` is parsed and never read; no `HIL_RC_INPUTS_RAW` is sent (§8.2).
  The old "InterLink RC ch2 is reversed" row was advice for a feature that does not exist.
- ~~**Battery / ICE fuel telemetry.**~~ **Implemented** — see §12.2.
- ~~**Multi-instance from `make`.**~~ **Implemented** — see §12.3.

### 12.2 Battery and fuel telemetry

RealFlight's battery is now carried into PX4's `battery_status`, replacing the synthetic
`battery_simulator` ramp. The route is not the obvious one, and the two dead ends are worth
recording because both look like they should work:

- **Not the simulator link.** `SimulatorMavlink::handle_message()` switches on exactly ten message
  ids (`HIL_SENSOR`, `HIL_OPTICAL_FLOW`, `ODOMETRY`, `VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE`,
  `DISTANCE_SENSOR`, `HIL_GPS`, `RC_CHANNELS`, `LANDING_TARGET`, `HIL_STATE_QUATERNION`,
  `RAW_RPM`) with no `BATTERY_STATUS` case and no default. A `BATTERY_STATUS` sent down TCP 4560 is
  parsed and silently discarded. `simulator_mavlink` only ever *subscribes* to `battery_status`.
- **Not HITL, at all.** On a real board `MavlinkReceiver::handle_message_hil_sensor()` publishes a
  **hardcoded** battery (`voltage_v = 16.0f`, `current_a = 10.0f`, `remaining = 0.70`) on **every**
  `HIL_SENSOR`. The bridge sends `HIL_SENSOR` at ~250 Hz, so a real reading injected at 2 Hz would
  be overwritten ~125 times between updates. No parameter disables it. Real battery telemetry on a
  HITL board requires patching PX4, which this project does not do.

What is implemented: the bridge opens a second UDP socket and sends `BATTERY_STATUS` at **2 Hz** to
`127.0.0.1:14580+instance`, PX4's API/offboard MAVLink link, where
`MavlinkReceiver::handle_message_battery_status()` does handle it. Two constraints on that path,
both of which silently eat the message if violated:

1. **MAVLink v2 only.** A v1 `BATTERY_STATUS` never reaches the topic, even though id 147 encodes
   fine in v1 and the `CRC_EXTRA` is identical (154). The bridge forces v2 on its channel.
2. **`sysid` must equal PX4's `MAV_SYS_ID`, `compid` must differ from PX4's.** The handler's first
   statement is
   `if ((msg->sysid != mavlink_system.sysid) || (msg->compid == mavlink_system.compid)) return;`.
   `rcS` sets `MAV_SYS_ID` to `px4_instance+1`, so the bridge transmits as sysid `instance+1`,
   compid 200.

The link is chosen deliberately: 14580 pins its remote with `-o`, so PX4 does **not** retarget its
output stream at the sender — measured at 0 packets / 0 bytes returned after a 10-packet burst,
which is what makes it safe to drive from the ~800 Hz exchange loop. The GCS link (18570) is
**not** used: it has no `-o` and latches its partner address from the first packet it receives, so
sending there would hijack the stream away from a real QGroundControl.

Three sources, selected per frame and logged on change:

| RealFlight reports | `remaining` from | `voltage_v` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| pack voltage > 0 (electric) | linear per-cell SOC, 3.30 V empty → 4.20 V full | measured | cell count inferred once from the first sample; `discharged_mah` coulomb-integrated |
| voltage = −1, fuel > 0 (IC) | `fuel_oz / max_fuel_oz_seen` | **nominal, not measured** | this is the −1 case the ledger used to flag; fuel is the physically meaningful "flying left", and a nominal voltage stops `BAT_V_EMPTY` firing on an armed aircraft |
| neither | 1.0 | nominal | obviously synthetic; logged as such |

Because the bridge is now the single publisher, the four SITL airframes set
`param set-default SIM_BAT_ENABLE 0`; otherwise `battery_simulator` and the bridge alternate on the
topic and the reading flickers between them. If the bridge cannot open its socket it says so, and
`SIM_BAT_ENABLE` should be set back to 1.

Full reasoning lives in `Tools/simulation/flightaxis/flightaxis_bridge/src/battery_link.h`.

### 12.3 Multi-instance

Wired through. `sitl_run.sh` reads **`PX4_FLIGHTAXIS_INSTANCE`** (default 0, validated as a
non-negative integer) and threads it to both ends: the bridge gets it as argv[1] (TCP `4560+i`) and
PX4 is launched with `-i $instance`, which is what makes `px4_instance` non-zero inside `rcS` and
therefore offsets the simulator port, every MAVLink UDP port, and `MAV_SYS_ID`. Instance 0 keeps the
historical `$build_path/rootfs` working directory; further instances use
`$build_path/instance_$i`, following PX4's own `Tools/simulation/sitl_multiple_run.sh`.

    PX4_FLIGHTAXIS_INSTANCE=1 PX4_FLIGHTAXIS_IP=<host> make px4_sitl_nolockstep flightaxis_quad

Note that earlier drafts claimed multi-instance "follows the FlightGear convention". That was true
and useless: PX4's own `Tools/simulation/flightgear/sitl_run.sh` hard-codes `0` in exactly the same
place, so neither runner supported it. In practice each instance still needs its own RealFlight
host — one RealFlight instance serves one aircraft.
